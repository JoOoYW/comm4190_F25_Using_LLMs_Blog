Hi! My name is Joy and I am an all-around curious and creative person who loves exploring new ideas, solving problems, and making things. Coding is my passion, besides web design. This started out as a project for my communications class, shout out to you Professor O’Donnell, and I wanted to continue with it! I am currently studying compuuter science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pennsylvania and in my free time, I like to crochet amigurumis.
