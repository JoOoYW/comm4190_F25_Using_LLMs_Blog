    "Colorectal cancer starts in the large intestine and the longer it is left untreated, the more in spreads until it becomes impossible to treat. Unfortunately, by the time symptoms are apparent it is too late for treatements like radiation or surgery. Still, it's been hypothesized and proposed in making use of machine learning to classify and identify cancerous tissue. "

    "The first round of sequencing and feature extraction resulted in an accuracy of about 0.619, or 61.9%. To really increase the power and accuracy, we sought to augment the pictures to \"create\" more data as we did not have access to any other data. The final method we used was transfer learning where the predictions output layer was changed to 8, everything but the output layer was frozen, and images were of size 150 pixels x 150 pixels. "

    "However, there are pitfalls and issues with this way of testing and researching. For one, it creates biases in recognition as, without knowing for certain who the samples were taken from, the data is limited to one group. But different races and genders have symptoms specific to their group, and in the age where AI does often discriminate based on who trains them, there is a lot of room for error. In addition, there is already a distrust and dislike for AI seeping into every corners of the world, especially when it concerns the wellbeing of others and themselves. Relying on any AI to accurately determine and diagnose the cause is and will always be *incredibly dangerous without further confirmation from a human's eye.* "
