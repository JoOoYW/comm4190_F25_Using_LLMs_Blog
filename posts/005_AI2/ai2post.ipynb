    "Colorectal cancer starts in the large intestine and the longer it is left untreated, the more in spreads until it becomes impossible to treat. Unfortunately, by the time symptoms are apparent it is too late for treatements like radiation or surgery. Still, it's been hypothesized and proposed in making use of machine learning to classify and identify cancerous tissue. In the summer of 2024, I and several others worked to figure out if it was possible. Using the data from The University of Jyväskylä, we trained an AI model to determine whether or not the tissue contained signs of cancer. "
