So far, I've beaten the \"final\" boss once and I have to beat the boss like four more times. I've asked Perplexity to create a short guide for me. \n",

    "## A basic strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core priorities\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn enemy patterns and stop attacking briefly when you see a new enemy or boss move; dodging safely matters more than squeezing in every hit.\n",
    "- Constantly move and dash, treating your dash as your main defensive tool; early on, prioritize mobility and survivability over raw damage.\n",
    "- Expect to die a lot and treat each run as resource farming for mirror upgrades, weapon aspects, and keepsakes rather than “failure”.\n",
    "### Mirror and resource strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spend darkness on extra dash, Death Defiance, and Chthonic Vitality / healing first, since these give you the biggest margin for error on real clears.\n",
    "- Use the weapon that glows with a darkness bonus to farm resources faster, even if it’s not your favorite, until your core mirror talents are upgraded\n",
    "- Use nectar once on key NPCs (especially Olympian gods and Skelly) to unlock strong keepsakes that boost survivability or give you guaranteed boons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boons and builds that carry\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prioritize defensive/mobility boons like Athena’s Divine Dash, Hermes extra dash and speed, and strong calls like Athena’s or Aphrodite’s Aid; they are widely recommended for surviving the final boss.\n",
    "- Build around a few powerful synergies instead of grabbing random damage: Athena + Ares (Merciful End), Zeus lightning builds, or Artemis crit builds are all known to trivialize many encounters when they come together.\n",
    "- For comfort, many players favor ranged-leaning setups (bow, cast-focused, or safe shield builds) so they can keep distance from dangerous enemies and Hades himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final boss habits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Treat Hades like a pattern-learning fight: keep your distance, circle him, and only step in when his current attack pattern leaves a clear opening.\n",
    "- Use pillars in the arena to block his projectiles and especially his beam/flamethrower in phase two; hiding behind terrain makes those attacks almost trivial.\n",
    "- Do not panic-dash around randomly; many experienced players recommend dashing into or through him to avoid wide swings, and using shield block or Athena dash to neutralize big attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple game plan per run\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick the darkness-bonus weapon unless you are on a serious “clear attempt,” in which case choose the weapon you play most confidently.\n",
    "- Use a survivability keepsake early (extra health, damage reduction, or Athena/Aphrodite keepsakes for guaranteed defensive boons), then swap later to a damage keepsake for Elysium and Styx.\n",
    "- In rooms, play patient: clear small threats first, stay mobile, and only greed damage when the room is under control; treat boss rooms and the final fight as pattern drills rather than DPS races.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you share what weapon you like most and roughly how far you’re getting (which boss or area), more tailored “one-build-to-clear” advice can narrow this down even further."

    "## A new focus\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, I asked what boons I should aim for and select because those can make or break a run. I love Athena's deflect and Aphrodite's cast, but if there are better ones I for sure need to get them. Perplexity's suggestion was to aim for Athena and Hermes almost every run, then layer in Aphrodite/Artemis (or Zeus/Dionysus) depending on whether you want safety or damage spikes. Prioritize a good dash, a strong attack/special boon, and at least one great Call.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An extensive inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "![The gods](gods.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Always high‑value gods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Athena: Divine Dash is widely considered the best boon in the game; it lets your dash deflect projectiles and massively cuts incoming damage. Her attack/special (Divine Strike/Flourish) also deflect and scale damage, and she can restore Death Defiance with Athena’s Aid tree.\n",
    "- Hermes: His boons give extra dashes, move speed, and dodge chance, which make every build safer and more forgiving. Hyper Sprint / Rush Delivery and attack-speed boosts are strong on nearly any weapon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gods for survivability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aphrodite: Weak on hit reduces enemy damage, and she offers flat damage reduction and max HP boosts, making her a top survival pick that still hits very hard. Aphrodite’s Aid is one of the strongest panic-button Calls for boss fights.\n",
    "- Dionysus: Hangover (damage over time) is easy to apply while kiting, and he has boons that heal after encounters or improve fountains, helping long-term survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gods for big damage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Artemis: Crit chance on attack/special/cast can shred bosses; boons like Exit Wounds or extra crit arrows turn certain builds into boss melters. She also pairs in strong duos like Merciful End with Ares or cast synergies with Poseidon.\n",
    "- Zeus: Great for room clear with chain lightning and lightning-on-dash; becomes very strong if you stack lightning upgrades and jolted on enemies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### “Auto-include” boons if offered\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defensive/mobility: Divine Dash (Athena), Athena’s attack/special, extra dashes (Hermes), move speed/dodge (Hermes), damage reduction or max HP from Aphrodite/Dionysus.\n",
    "- Boss tools: Aphrodite’s Aid, Athena’s Aid, or a high-level Call from Zeus/Dionysus all make Hades much safer and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you tell which weapon/aspect you like, a specific “god priority list” for that weapon can be laid out so you know exactly what to pick on doors."
