    "The origin of a final meal has not been well documented, but since the 1891 there was great interest in the idea. Believed to have religious and historical roots, with the Last Supper in Christianity being a significant early example, the practice of granting customized final meals to those on death row is a more recent, and peculiarly American, fascination.

    "But over the years, there have been restrictions and some states, like Texas, have stopped the practice of customized last meals. The reason for this is understandable as in 2011, Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a [grandiose meal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/23/texas-execution-ends-final-meal) and then refused to eat it. The uneaten meal caused public outcry and a strong reaction from state officials, particularly Senator John Whitmire, who called the privilege \"extremely inappropriate\". \n",

    "## The Process\n",
    "The first thing to do is make sure the AI knows what my food preferences are. I chose Google's Gemini to be my own chef and started with the prompt, **<span style = 'color: #57c9c6'>pretend you are a chef and i am on death row requesting my final meal. ask me anything, one at a time, like a private chef would to curate the best final meal for me</span>**. My assumption is that Gemini would ask me about my cultural background, what I would eat as a child, any dietary concerns, etc. I will answer them truthfully and take note of what I think I would ask instead or add on.

    "## 21 Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question Gemini, or Chef Antione, asked me was: <span style = 'color: #e388da'>tell me,what kind of experience are you hoping for tonight? Are we aiming for comfort, nostalgia, a grand celebration, or perhaps something entirely new?</span> In my opinion, asking for a final meal envoking thoughts of childhood is most appropriate so I replied with: <span style = 'color: #57c9c6'>i'm leaning towards comfort and nostalgia so wat sort of dishes would you envision for that?</span>. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Gemini says: <span style = 'color: #e388da'>Ah, comfort and nostalgia. A beautiful choice. It often evokes images of home, warmth, and cherished memories. To help me paint a clearer picture, tell me, when you envision this meal, does it lean more towards something deeply savory and hearty, perhaps a dish that's been slow-cooked with love, or do you find yourself drawn to the lighter, perhaps even slightly sweet, simple pleasures of a specific memory?</span> I find myself gravtitating more towards hearty/savory meals, so I reply as such. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Now we start getting into childhood memories which tie to cultural background. I went with Thanksgiving meal of <span style = 'color: #57c9c6'>definitely during thanksgiving when my dad would make scallion pancakes and lion’s head, and when my mom would make dumplings and stir fry beef chow fun</span>. From this, Gemini asked me what about the dishes I mentioned made them so special. So I said the taste and texture, and the memory of making these dishes with them! I also purposely ommitted that I am allergic to crustaceans since Gemini asked me about dumpling fillings, <span style = 'color: #e388da'>...what was the primary filling for these dumplings? Was it pork, chicken, shrimp, a vegetable medley, or a combination? Knowing the star ingredient will help me ensure that light seasoning perfectly complements it.</span>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "After going through each dish I mentioned and what I loved about it, we moved onto a beverage I liked. There are so many I could choose from, but I have and will always love a drink called [iced lemon black tea](https://www.sayweee.com/en/grocery-near-me/lang-en/explore/bing-hong-cha). And to round it out, Gemini asked me about my dessert preferences which was hard so I opted to mention two, <span style = 'color: #57c9c6'>it’s so hard to choose, but i would go for red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting and the white chocolate raspberry truffle from cheesecake factory</span>."

    "\n",
    "Chef Antoine is confident that we have now assembled a truly extraordinary final meal, a symphony of comfort, nostalgia, and exquisite flavors, deeply personal to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me just quickly recap this magnificent feast to ensure every detail is precisely as you envision:\n",
    "\n",
    "**To Begin:**\n",
    "- Your father's Scallion Pancakes, with their unique crispy texture, savory dough, fresh scallions, and perfectly infused oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Main Course:**\n",
    "- Your father's Lion's Head, featuring incredibly tender meat and a rich broth balanced with the warmth of anise and ginger, a nuanced sweetness, and served with slightly crunchy bok choy.\n",
    "- Your mother's Steamed Dumplings, with delicate wrappers, a light seasoning for the pork (and sometimes shrimp) filling, brightened by garlic chives and corn, all accompanied by her heavenly vinegar dipping sauce.\n",
    "- Your mother's Stir-Fry Beef Chow Fun, with perfectly textured noodles, crisp bean sprouts, fresh scallions, the option of scrambled egg, and that distinct, smoky \"wok hei\" char.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To Quench Your Thirst:**\n",
    "- Perfectly brewed and chilled Bing Hong Cha (Iced Lemon Black Tea).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For a Sweet Conclusion:**\n",
    "- A comforting slice of Red Velvet Cake, moist and dense, with subtle cocoa notes and a tangy, rich cream cheese frosting.\n",
    "- And, a luxurious White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, dense and creamy, bursting with fruity flavor, and crowned with light whipped cream.\n",
    "This truly is a meal crafted from the heart, honoring your cherished memories."

    "## A Picture\n",
    "From Copilot, I generated an image to see what they would think and to be honest, it was a strange picture. I know personally what each dish is supposed to look like, so I want to point out that the scallion pancakes look more like an egg frittata and the beef chow fun appears twice. Both times, it looks wet (which it shouldn't). Also, there's no cheesecake."

    "## My thoughts \n",
    "There are several things I want to say. First, Gemini would NOT let go of what made specifically my dad's scallion pancakes so comforting. Without reminding them they only have 21 questions, I think it would go on for like 5 more questions which is so redundant. I honestly have no idea why they would just keep on pestering me about one dish. Second, I don't know if I should have proposed those dishes because there was no investigating on Gemini's part. It simply took what I said and then pretended it was curated."
