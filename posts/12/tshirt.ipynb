    "On November 23 at 12 PM, one of the TAs for CIS 1600 posted on my [edstem.org](edstem.org/us/dashboard) about the annual CIS 1600 merch design contest. Now, I like desiging things, but to design one for a STEM course, much less one of THE nerdiest courses you can take is a challenge. It's hard to make it look good and \"hip\". So what's to do? "

    "Unfortunately, it's not easy to make a STEM related t-shirt without making it cringey. Most, if not all of these shirts, are jokes on a graphic tee in a duotone color scheme. So, here's my thought process. One, it should absolutely be related to teh calss in some way and two, it should have a small, pretty picture. Throughout this class, Professor has continously said the same phrase, even though I never believe in it. That is, \"Life is Good\". \n",

    "In my mind, I picture a sunset with \"Life is Good\" in a cartoon ending-esque font as it represents all of my dreams about to be crushed. I imagine there should be a CIS 1600 logo somewhere on it, but I just don't know where. Would it be at the bottom? Near the heart like the Polo™ logo? Hidden like a Where's Waldo situation? So many choices, but none of them look good."
