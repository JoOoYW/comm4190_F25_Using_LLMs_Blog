    "\n",
    "To test them, I wanted to explore their expertise on crocheting! Crocheting is defined as the [\"process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials\"](https://sarahmaker.com/what-is-crochet/) and is derived from the French word 'crochet' meaning hook. There are many techniques and steps to follow before a project, or design, can come to fruition. But the question still stands, can ChatGPT, or any chatbot really, give an answer that makes something decent? Chatbots are known to give information that needs to be double checked in some way, shape, or form before trusting it completely. So, what better way to test a chatbot's correctness than to make a decoration just in time for Halloween!"
