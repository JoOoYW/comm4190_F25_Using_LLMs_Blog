Now, it operates as both Panera BreadÂ® or Saint Louis Bread Co St. Louis Bread Company in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Canada!"

    "A fan favorite across the board (save for the people who are lactose intolerant). One of my favorite meals to eat when at Panera Bread and overall a ten across the board. Not only does it come with a great vehicle for the sauce, but the taste is phenomenal. In addition, the baguettes they make are impeccable and very delicious. The closest Panera Bread for UPenn students is located at 200 South 40th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 across from the Acme. "
