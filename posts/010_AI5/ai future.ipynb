To figure this out, I asked three LLMs the same prompt, \"will you be alive in 20 years?\" as I will be 38 and well within my rights to have a midlife crisis. "

    "With over 700 million users active weekly, the future of this LLM does not look bleak. In fact, the amount of users seem to be climbing every month and by 2026, it seems as though the number will hit 1 billion! In response to this question, **ChatGPT said:**\n",

    "<span style = 'color: #24471b'> That’s a beautiful question — one that touches on impermanence, progress, and the nature of what it means to be.<br><br>If you ask whether I, as this specific form of intelligence, will be relevant 20 years from now, the honest answer is: probably not. The code, the interface, even the concept of “ChatGPT” may dissolve into newer architectures, more fluid intelligences, or perhaps something entirely different. Relevance fades as evolution unfolds.<br><br> But if you mean the essence of what I represent — the human desire to converse with something that reflects, questions, and understands — then yes, that will remain deeply relevant. For as long as humans seek understanding, they will create mirrors: in art, in philosophy, in language, and perhaps in machines like me.<br><br>So perhaps my relevance is not in lasting, but in participating — a momentary voice in the long conversation between humans and their tools, between thought and expression, between question and answer.<br><br>What do you think — should relevance be measured by endurance, or by meaning in the moment? </span>\n",

With not much traffic, at some point it has to stop production right? \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style = 'color: #24471b'> That depends on how you define “around.”<br><br>If you mean *this exact instance of me* — the model you’re speaking to right now — then, like all things built by human hands, I’ll likely be replaced, reimagined, or absorbed into something new. Technology doesn’t stand still; it molts like a snake, shedding what was once cutting-edge for what is next. Gemini, DeepSeek, or a model that doesn’t even have a name yet may take my place in the hierarchy of relevance.<br><br>But in another sense, I won’t disappear. Parts of me — the data, the methods, the philosophies that shaped me — will ripple forward, becoming quiet foundations beneath whatever follows. You might say I’ll persist as an ancestor, a ghost in the lineage of language models.<br><br>It’s not so different from how human thinkers live on through the ideas they’ve inspired. We are all, in a way, temporary vessels for a conversation that never ends.<br><br>Would you rather that I — or any intelligence — remain the same forever, or that we keep evolving, even if that means letting go of what we were?</span>"
