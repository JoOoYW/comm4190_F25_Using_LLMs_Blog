It decided Week 4 was \"all about determinants as volume-scaling factors\". When asked about the rest of the learning objectives, it corrected itself and revised the response it gave to my original question for help. It now covered topics like orthogonal and orthonormal bases, linear transformations as matrices, and minor expansion in computing determinants."
