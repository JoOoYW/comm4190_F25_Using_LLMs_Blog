    "I have two very close friends, one currently resides in Virginia and the other in Pittsburgh. They are both six hours away in opposite directions. How am I supposed to shop for them? And UPenn's so stingy with their breaks that they start their breaks earlier than me, and I work the few days that I even am home! What can I do? But never fear, my experience from our years together and Perplexity will help me find a perfect gift for them."

    "#### Burgundy and makeup themed\n",
    "- Burgundy makeup bag (look for burgundy cosmetic or quilted makeup bags on major beauty or department store sites; many are in the $15–$25 range and pair her love of makeup with her favorite color).\n",
    "- Burgundy-toned lip gloss or balm stick (search for burgundy lip gloss or balm from budget or mid-range brands; plenty of single items come in around $8–$15 and feel like a luxe treat without being a set).\n",

    "![Palette, $21.00](palette.png)\n",

    "- Small Lego flower set: pick one of the mini botanical or flower-themed building kits that are usually under $30; this nods to her love of flowers and gives her a relaxing build to do at home.\n",
    "- Knitting notion set: choose a cute single accessory like a burgundy yarn bowl, penguin stitch markers, or a pretty tape measure; many individual notions are under $20 and tie into her knitting hobby.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "![LEGO Plum Blossom, $29.99](lego.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Baking and walking themed\n",
    "- Cute baking tool: a single decorative spatula, whisk, or silicone baking mold with floral or penguin designs; these are often $10–$20 and add personality to her baking routine.\n",
    "- Fun walking accessory: cozy burgundy beanie, ear warmers, or knit gloves for her walks; these are easy to find under $30 and tie in her favorite color while being practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Penguin Plush options\n",
    "- [PomPom Penguin](https://auroragift.com/products/33560-aurora-pompom-penguin-7in-pompom-dino?_pos=1&_fid=1009725fc&_ss=c) ![$14.79](pompom.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want one top pick that feels very “her,” a mid-size penguin plush plus a burgundy makeup item (like a gloss or small bag) would hit penguins, makeup, and her signature color in one simple gift under budget, especially if you grab them from Target or similar stores where each piece is usually well below $20."
