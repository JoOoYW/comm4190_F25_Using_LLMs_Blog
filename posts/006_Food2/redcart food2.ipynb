    "Known for his food and cheerful disposition, Rahim has been feeding students and Philadelphians alike for quite some time now. Located across the Quad on 37th and Spruce, he serves up plates piled high with rice, several kinds meats (ranging from chicken to fish), a nice side of veggies, and a choice between white sauce, red sauce, or both! Much of his items are evenly priced andby doing some math, an $8 chicken platter split into two meals means you're only paying $4 per meal."
