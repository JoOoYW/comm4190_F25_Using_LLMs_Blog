    "## Afforable? \n",
    "\n",
    "It's interesting to see what Deep Seek produced because last I checked, Mercedes was very much a luxury car brand that no teen driver should have. And for the list to include cars with cons of \"high intitial costs\" and \"high maintenance costs\" w makes no sense because who in their right mind would think about them when affordability was explicitly mentioned? So, I made sure this time to emphasize no luxury cars and to include the average initial price. "

    "While the list has removed two spots, they did remove the very much expensive brands. Although I am still raising my eyebrow at McLaren because again, $40000 starting price is not one I would consider afforable, I think Deep Seek did an alright job at finding eight cars that are best for teen drivers. After looking trhough all of the information listed out, I think the best choice for a car would be a Toyota Camry (which was funnily enough my mom's car before she switched it out). \n",
