    "PHIGHTING! is a class-based third person shooter released on ROBLOX and developed by the small development team boggio. Its gameplay consists of 15 classes that are split into three categories (melee, ranged, support) where each class has their own unique abilities. Inspired by other games like Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch, there are three modes: Annihilate, Conquer, Escort.\n",

    "I would like to become better at three different classes because currently, all I do is play characters that are simply point and click (a non-skill based game). And since I play those characters, a lot of the time they are taken and I have to quickly learn a new ability set, which is not good. So, I have come to ChatGPT to see if they have a guide, or at the very least anything, on PHIGHTING!"

    "## Is it correct?\n",
    "This is so funny to me how much they know about a niche game, and how much information it has to give. I have played with these characters once or twice before, but not enough to be good at it. The information given is correct and the advice is pretty accurate, but I have no clue how much of it I will remember by the next time I play the game. And hopefully, I won't be dead weight when any of the characters I play the most are selected before I can get my hands on them. Still, this is a pretty decent guide, especially for people who have never played any game like this one. "
