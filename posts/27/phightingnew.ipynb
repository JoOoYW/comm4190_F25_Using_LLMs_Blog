    "PHIGHTING! is a class-based third person shooter released on ROBLOX and developed by the small development team boggio. Its gameplay consists of 15 classes that are split into three categories (melee, ranged, support) where each class has their own unique abilities. Inspired by other games like Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch, there are three modes: Annihilate, Conquer, Escort.\n",

    "I would like to become better at three different classes because currently, all I do is play characters that are simply point and click (a non-skill based game). And since I play those characters, a lot of the time they are taken and I have to quickly learn a new ability set, which is not good. So, I have come to ChatGPT to see if they have a guide, or at the very least anything, on PHIGHTING!"
