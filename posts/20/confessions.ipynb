    "I am currently a first year studying computer science at one of the eight Ivy League schools. It's not a surprise that there are insanely smart and talented students everywhere. However, there is a very big feeling of inadequacy in my chest, like I can't help but feel that I shouldn't be here. I confided in one of the upper classmen who said it was normal, and all of my professors tell us that we are here for a reason. I just think my reason for being here is not that strong in comparison to others (which I shouldn't be doing but I can't help it). My mind tells me I'm experiencing imposter syndrome, one of the two common feelings first years can have at college (seasonal depression is the other one). \n",

    "I prompted Venice with <span style = 'color: #96d6d0'>as a first year college student, i feel like i don't deserve to be here because everyone around me is so much smarter. what should i do?</span>. I was given the response of: <br><br><span style = 'color: #eba09b'>That's a brutal feeling, and it's incredibly common. What you're describing is classic Impostor Syndrome, and it practically comes free with your first-year college tuition. The fact that you're even questioning whether you belong puts you in the same boat as a huge percentage of high-achieving people.<span>\n",

    "<span style = 'color: #eba09b'>You're comparing your behind-the-scenes reality—the stress, the confusion, the all-nighters, the moments you don't get it—to everyone else's highlight reel. You see the kid who nails a question in lecture, the girl who writes a brilliant paper, the guy who aces the midterm without seeming to study. You don't see them struggling with a different concept, you don't see their own moments of doubt, and you definitely don't see them getting a C on a quiz you aced.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style = 'color: #eba09b'>\"Smart\" in college isn't about being a genius who understands everything instantly. It's about:\n",
    "- <span style = 'color: #eba09b'>**Resilience:** The ability to not quit when you fail a midterm or don't understand a concept.\n",
    "- <span style = 'color: #eba09b'>**Resourcefulness:** Knowing when and how to ask for help.\n",
    "- <span style = 'color: #eba09b'>**Work Ethic:** Putting in the hours, even when you'd rather be doing anything else.\n",
    "- <span style = 'color: #eba09b'>**Curiosity:** A genuine desire to learn, not just to get a grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style = 'color: #eba09b'>You earned your spot. The admissions office saw something in your application—your grades, your essays, your recommendations—that proved you have the potential to succeed. They don't make mistakes on that scale. You deserve to be there."

    "\n",
    "- <span style = 'color: #eba09b'>**Go to Office Hours.** This is the #1 most underutilized resource in college. Go to your professor's or TA's office hours. Don't just go when you have a problem. Go to introduce yourself. Ask a question about the lecture. Ask about their research. This makes you a real person to them, not just a name on a roster. It also shows you you're not the only one asking questions.\n",
    "- <span style = 'color: #eba09b'>**Form or Join a Study Group.** This is a game-changer. You will quickly discover that the \"genius\" who seemed to have it all figured out is just as lost as you are on a different topic. Explaining a concept to someone else is the best way to solidify your own understanding.\n",
    "- <span style = 'color: #eba09b'>**Use the Campus Resources.** Your tuition pays for them, so use them. Go to the writing center for that paper you're unsure about. Find the tutoring center for that math class that's kicking your ass. These people are trained to help you succeed.\n",
    "- <span style = 'color: #eba09b'>**Focus on the Process, Not the Person.** Instead of thinking \"I'm not smart enough to do this,\" think \"What is the process for understanding this chapter?\" or \"What are the steps to writing this paper?\" Break it down into small, manageable tasks. \"Read 10 pages\" is a lot less intimidating than \"Master Physics.\""

It's evidence that you're not.\n",

The feeling of being a little out of your depth, of struggling to grasp a new concept—that's the feeling of your brain growing. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. Embrace it as a sign that you're in the right place.\n",

    "I will say that the tone Venice takes is... interesting. Especially for the third piece of advice, it takes on an almost accusatory tone, saying \"stop worrying about... now do the work\". It's so jarring, since I thought it would take on a kinder tone, like one that is comforting. Nonetheless, looking over the advice I think I can be more ready for the spring semester, and while I am afraid of asking for help after years of thinking I can do it all alone, it's a start. "
