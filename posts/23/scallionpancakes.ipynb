    "## My dad's recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, like a true Asian my dad refuses to measure out exact ingredients so here's an estimation of how much he uses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ingredients \n",
    "* [ ] 500g AP flour\n",
    "* [ ] 300mL lukewarm water\n",
    "* [ ] 10g salt\n",
    "* [ ] 3 bunches of green scallions (white and green)\n",
    "* [ ] 40mL of high smoke point oil (we use peanut oil)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "##### Dough:\n",
    "1. Mix the flour, salt, and water together in a large mixing bowl\n",
    "2. Once combined sufficiently, move it to a surface with flour and knead until smooth\n",
    "3. form a round ball\n",
    "4. Grab your choice of oil and put some onto the surface\n",
    "5. Let the dough bowl sit for an hour\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Layers\n",
    "To form the layers inside of the scallion pancake, you need to add a mixture of oil and flour\n",
    "1. Mix the oil and some flour into a small mixing bowl\n",
    "2. Take a small ball of dough and flatten it out\n",
    "3. Make it into a circle\n",
    "4. Add the oil mixture down the middle, avoiding the sides\n",
    "5. Sprinkle the chopped green scallions onto the oil\n",
    "6. Fold the sides into the middle so it's one long strip\n",
    "7. Roll it up into a cinnamon roll and pinch the end into the dough\n",
    "8. Roll it out again into a circle\n",
    "9. Repeat step 8 two more times\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Frying \n",
    "1. Add enough oil into the pan and heat it up\n",
    "2. Drop a pancake and fry until both sides are golden brown, or at least cooked\n",
    "3. Enjoy!"

    "3. Add the room-temperature water and mix until a rough dough forms.\n",

    "5. Cover and let rest **30 minutes** (this relaxes the gluten and makes rolling easier).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Finely slice scallions.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 3️⃣ Roll and fill\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide dough into **4 equal balls**.\n",
    "2. Roll one ball into a thin circle (~8 inches).\n",
    "3. Brush lightly with oil.\n",
    "4. Sprinkle scallions evenly over the surface.\n",
    "5. Sprinkle a pinch of salt.\n",

    "**Spiral method (traditional)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Roll the dough into a tight log.\n",
    "2. Coil the log into a spiral (like a cinnamon roll).\n",
    "3. Flatten gently with your hand.\n",
    "4. Roll out again into a pancake (~6–7 inches).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5️⃣ Cook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heat a skillet over **medium-medium low** heat.\n",
    "2. Add enough oil to coat the pan.\n",
    "3. Cook pancake **2–3 minutes per side**, pressing gently, until:\n",
    "   * Golden brown\n",
    "   * Crispy outside\n",
    "   * Soft inside\n",

    "#### 🌟 Tips for best results\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hot water = tender, chewy pancakes (this replaces yeast).\n",
    "* Don’t overcrowd scallions or they’ll tear the dough.\n",

    "Looking through ChatGPT's reipe, I will say it is almost indentical to my dad's! What is peculiar to me is that the cinnamon roll roll-up method is considered the \"traditional\" method, which makes me wonder how else would you fold it to get the layers? I also find it interesting they say to use a neutral oil and to cook on lower heat even though by that time, the outside will become overcooked and the inside remains raw! Still, it looks like it will make some delicious looking scalion pancakes. "
