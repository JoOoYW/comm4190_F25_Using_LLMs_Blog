    "Ben and Jerry's started in a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont, using what they knew from the one $5 ice cream course they took at Penn State. Today, they have about 100 flavors churning away to reach everyone and anyone. Me personally, I like **Strawberry Cheesecake** and **Mud Cake**. The crunchy bits and ice cream flavor give it such an amazing texture and taste that I just can never get enough of them. I absolutely detest when the toppings are soggy, like **Americone Dream**. But what does ChatGPT think about all of these flavors?"

    "### Ranking \n",
    "\n",
    "To start off, I wanted to see what kind of ranking ChatGPT would create. It prefaced that \"ranking all Ben & Jerry's flavors is a fun but subjective task\" as people have all kinds of preferences that would of course impavt what it pulls. Nonetheless, the top 10 flavors it spat out was as follows: <br>\n",
    "1. Half Baked <br>\n",
    "2. The Tonight Dough <br>\n",
    "3. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough <br>\n",
    "4. Cherry Garcia <br>\n",
    "5. Phish Food <br>\n",
    "6. Americone Dream <br>\n",
    "7. Peanut Butter Cup <br>\n",
    "8. Netflix and Chill'd <br>\n",
    "9. Strawberry Cheesecake <br>\n",
    "10. New York Super Fudge Chunk <br>\n",

    "### Best and Worst Flavors\n",
    "\n",
    "I then wanted to see what flavor ChatGPT liked the most where after it considered flavor balance, texture, originality, and pure indulgence, it decided **The Tonight Dough** was it's favorite. The reasoning? It has caramel, chocolate ice cream, cookie dough, chocolate cookie swirls, and peanut butter cookie dough! A little something for everyone in my opinion. And when asked about the worst flavor, it chose a discontinued flavor in many areas, **Banana Split**. It seems as though the banana ice cream base was either too artificial tasting or overpowering and that unlike all of the mix-ins in **The Tonight Dough**, the ones in **Banana Split** just had too much going on. There were fudge chunks, walnuts, cherries, and strawberries that  fell flat when trying to replicate the taste of a banana split. One thing to note is that the flavor **Sugar Plum** was also considered as the worst. "
