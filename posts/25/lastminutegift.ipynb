    "I understand. Life can get really hectic and anything not that important as of right now will always get pushed into the back of your mind, left to sit on the backburners of the stove. However, don't be confused when the item you're trying to look for on December 23rd is sold out! And I implore you to give me any information about the person when you ask me \"what should I get them?\". I'm not a mind reader, but I want to help. \n",

    "So I think I need to have a repertoire of rapid fire questions I can ask to the shopper so that the gift they select is one, in store or makes it to the location in time if shipped, and two, can be used by the gift receiver in question. And because Google has a section dedicated to shopping (that I use frequently), I'm curious as to how Gemini responds."

    "<br>I decided that this imaginary gift would be for my brother who is currently 16 years old with a budget of under $30. I'd rather it be something I can pick up locally or an experience rather than a gift card. From this, Gemini gave me five items and four experiences but without asking for their interests or hobbies. Because of that, I follow up with his likes: Pokémon, Hollow Knight, and go karting. "

    "## A good choice?\n",
    "In my opinion, the gift ideas are decent; not the worst, but not the best. I might have gotten him something controller related or a Hollow Knight figure, but not what they suggest. I would have selected maybe a backbone for the phone, or a blanket with the Korok. But Funko POP! is a very nice idea, especially with the DIY one you can get since they have no Hollow Knight series. But if all else fails, I go to crochet a plush. And I like the arcade idea, both him and I enjoy getting tickets and winning prizes. The race karting option is not as appealing, as presenting a small toy race car at his age is so funny to me. If I were to do that, I would just bring him and some friends to go go-kart somewhere. \n",
