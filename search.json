    "text": "Machine Learning and Diagnosing\nIn the summer of 2024, I and several others worked to figure out if it was possible. Using the data from the University of Jyv√§skyl√§, we trained an AI model to determine whether or not the tissue contained signs of cancer.\n \nThe first round of sequencing and feature extraction resulted in an accuracy of about 0.619, or 61.9%. To really increase the power and accuracy, we sought to augment the pictures to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù more data as we did not have access to any other data. The final method we used was transfer learning where the predictions output layer was changed to 8, everything but the output layer was frozen, and images were of size 150 pixels x 150 pixels.\n \nA confusion matrix, a table used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a classification model provides a more detailed insight into a model‚Äôs peformance. We had produced two confusion matrixes, one with the 61.9% as stated above and the new one, after transfer learning, was 84.4%. The accuracy in predicting eight categories of colorectal tissue grew tremendously, and this AI is capable of being integrated with other models.\n | \nHowever, there are pitfalls and issues with this way of testing and researching. For one, it creates biases in recognition as, without knowing for certain who the samples were taken from, the data is limited to one group. But different races and genders have symptoms specific to their group, and in the age where AI does often discriminate based on who trains them, there is a lot of room for error. In addition, there is already a distrust and dislike for AI seeping into every corners of the world, especially when it concerns the wellbeing of others and themselves. Relying on any AI to accurately determine and diagnose the cause is and will always be incredibly dangerous without further confirmation from a human‚Äôs eye.\nFor further interest: The University of Jyv√§skyl√§ and our in-depth examination Precision Medicine in Colorectal Cancer"
