    "text": "Prompting\nIn 2024, a query circulated around the internet of someone asking a simple question to ChatGPT, “How many ‘r’s’ in ‘strawberry’”. The answer? Two, according to GPT-4o. Now how could that be? Are we really sure AI will take over jobs in the future? Where did ChatGPT go wrong?\nChatGPT and other LLM’s are based off of tokenization, the process of taking the whole prompt and chunking it down to an average of four characters per token. They then turn those gorups of characters into token IDs, and based on all of the values and weightings, it then passes them through different parameters (and a small amount of randomness), output whatever it thinks best matches your request. For something to iterate over thousands of words, it uses up a lot of energy and natural resources. And that means it can’t directly count the number of letters in a word. For a word like Mississippi which can be broken down into {4I, 2P, 4S, 1M}, LLM’s may see it as MISSISSIPPI. So in the case of strawberry, it’s a token boundary issue where because the intervals of counting characters are determined in a tricky way, the model lacks an internal letter-level representation. One ‘r’ might be at the end of one token and two ’r’s in the middle of the next token), thus fumbling the count.\n\n\n\nExample of how a prompt is broken down"

The solution is quite easy to figure out, simply take 8 and 6 from the ones, multiply them together, and add up the digits of their product: 8 * 6 = 48 → 4 + 8 = 12.\n\nprint(725278 * 67066)\n\n[1] 48641494348\n\n\nContrary to popular beliefs, ChatGPT and many other LLMs are unable to do arithmetic like a computer’s calculator program. Rather, they generate text based on learned patterns, which is why it can produce errors, particularly with tasks that require precise, deterministic calculations. Again, they rely on tokens which can break up the digits in a way that would produce an error, such as 168812*980/456-9533699 becoming 168812*980/456-9533699. If you do rely on ChatGT or Gemini for any sort of problem set, always double check the calculations on your own. In fact, it would be more reliable to use a specialized tool or algorithm that explicitly performs calculations.\nI highly suggest using the tokenizer website to see how GPT splits the prompt into tokens!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ben and Jerry’s started in a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont, using what they knew from the one $5 ice cream course they took at Penn State. Today, they have about 100 flavors churning away to reach everyone and anyone. Me personally, I like Strawberry Cheesecake and Mud Cake. The crunchy bits and ice cream flavor give it such an amazing texture and taste that I just can never get enough of them. I absolutely detest when the toppings are soggy, like Americone Dream. But what does ChatGPT think about all of these flavors?\n\n\n\nFounders Ben and Jerry\n\n\n\nRanking\nTo start off, I wanted to see what kind of ranking ChatGPT would create. It prefaced that “ranking all Ben & Jerry’s flavors is a fun but subjective task” as people have all kinds of preferences that would of course impavt what it pulls. Nonetheless, the top 10 flavors it spat out was as follows:  1. Half Baked  2. The Tonight Dough  3. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough  4. Cherry Garcia  5. Phish Food  6. Americone Dream  7. Peanut Butter Cup  8. Netflix and Chill’d  9. Strawberry Cheesecake  10. New York Super Fudge Chunk \nAnd like most lists, there are some honorable mentions that fell just a bit short, such as Gimme S’more!, Salted Caramel Core, and Chunky Monkey.\n\n\nBest and Worst Flavors\nI then wanted to see what flavor ChatGPT liked the most where after it considered flavor balance, texture, originality, and pure indulgence, it decided The Tonight Dough was it’s favorite. The reasoning? It has caramel, chocolate ice cream, cookie dough, chocolate cookie swirls, and peanut butter cookie dough! A little something for everyone in my opinion. And when asked about the worst flavor, it chose a discontinued flavor in many areas, Banana Split. It seems as though the banana ice cream base was either too artificial tasting or overpowering and that unlike all of the mix-ins in The Tonight Dough, the ones in Banana Split just had too much going on. There were fudge chunks, walnuts, cherries, and strawberries that fell flat when trying to replicate the taste of a banana split. One thing to note is that the flavor Sugar Plum was also considered as the worst.\n \n\n\nA New Flavor?\nThe last thing I wanted to see was if ChatGPT could come up with a new flavor. In my mind, cannot create anything new. Everything is either regurgitated information from a single source or an attempt to combine and link multiples sources from every inch of the internet. I was, however, impressed that ChatGPT designed somewhat of a new flavor. It came up with:\n\n🍰🔥 “Midnight Bake”\nA celebration of warm homemade treats with a gooey, salty-sweet twist.\n\n\n🥄 Flavor Profile:\nBase: Toasted brown sugar ice cream 🍯 (like a warm cookie straight from the oven) Mix-ins: Chunks of molten fudge brownies 🍫  Swirls of salted caramel 🧂  Pieces of browned butter blondie dough 🍪 Bits of toasty oats & cinnamon crumble 🌾 Bonus swirl: Cookie butter ripple 🧁✨ for spice and creaminess\n\n\n🎯 Why it works:\nHits that sweet-salty-spicy-rich spectrum Feels like a hybrid of baking all your favorite treats at once Great for fall/winter cozy vibes, sleepovers, or midnight cravings Encore-worthy texture combos: gooey, chewy, crunchy, creamy\nIt’s worth noting he name Midnight Bake is a combination of already existing flavors Half Baked and Late Night Snack. But it does sound tasty!\n\n\n\nMidnight Bake Imagined\nI did want to see what the pint tub could possible look like, so I moved to Dall-E and used the prompt:\n🖼️ Imagined Pint Design: 🎨 Name: Midnight Bake 🎨 Theme: Cozy, indulgent, and a little mysterious — like a late-night kitchen adventure.\nPint Artwork Description: Background: Midnight blue and burnt caramel tones, with a glowing oven light and baked goods scattered on a countertop next to a messy mixing bowl. Centerpiece: A cartoon-style brownie and blondie wearing oven mitts high-fiving while standing on a swirl of golden caramel.\nDetails: Cookie crumbs scattered near the top A cinnamon stick and whisk crossed like utensils of honor The Ben & Jerry’s signature banner across the top A tagline written under the name: “Brownies, blondies & late-night bliss.”\n🍧 Scoop Description (The Ice Cream Itself): Imagine cracking into a pint and seeing:\nA light golden-brown ice cream base with visible specks (toasted brown sugar) Rich gooey caramel swirls winding across the surface Big, dense brownie chunks and lighter, chewy blondie dough pieces peeking through Thin streaks of cookie butter twirling through every other bite A delicate oat crumble layering here and there like a pie topping baked inside\nIt came up with this image that I also removed the background to just display the tub itself. I will say, Dall-E did make this new ice cream flavor look good!"

    "text": "Machine Learning and Diagnosing\nIn the summer of 2024, I and several others worked to figure out if it was possible. Using the data from the University of Jyväskylä, we trained an AI model to determine whether or not the tissue contained signs of cancer.\n \nThe first round of sequencing and feature extraction resulted in an accuracy of about 0.619, or 61.9%. To really increase the power and accuracy, we sought to augment the pictures to “create” more data as we did not have access to any other data. The final method we used was transfer learning where the predictions output layer was changed to 8, everything but the output layer was frozen, and images were of size 150 pixels x 150 pixels.\n \nA confusion matrix, a table used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a classification model provides a more detailed insight into a model’s peformance. We had produced two confusion matrixes, one with the 61.9% as stated above and the new one, after transfer learning, was 84.4%. The accuracy in predicting eight categories of colorectal tissue grew tremendously, and this AI is capable of being integrated with other models.\n | \nHowever, there are pitfalls and issues with this way of testing and researching. For one, it creates biases in recognition as, without knowing for certain who the samples were taken from, the data is limited to one group. But different races and genders have symptoms specific to their group, and in the age where AI does often discriminate based on who trains them, there is a lot of room for error. In addition, there is already a distrust and dislike for AI seeping into every corners of the world, especially when it concerns the wellbeing of others and themselves. Relying on any AI to accurately determine and diagnose the cause is and will always be incredibly dangerous without further confirmation from a human’s eye.\nFor further interest: The University of Jyväskylä and our in-depth examination Precision Medicine in Colorectal Cancer"

So, what better way to test a chatbot’s correctness than to make a decoration just in time for Halloween!\n\n\n\nStoryland Amis Black Kitty Cat\n\n\nI gave openAI’s ChatGPT a single task, “give me a set of instructions to crochet a small black cat plushie for my witch costume”. It produced this:"

    "text": "Rahim Khan and the  red cart \nKnown for his food and cheerful disposition, Rahim has been feeding students and Philadelphians alike for quite some time now. Located across the Quad on 37th and Spruce, he serves up plates piled high with rice, several kinds meats — ranging from chicken to fish, a nice side of veggies, and a choice between white sauce, red sauce, or both!\n\n\n\nThe $8 Chicken Platter\n\n\nA further look into his menu shows a wide range of meals students can get. The portion size is massive, especially for students who are on a tight budget and have to make every dollar last. And, by doing a little bit of food math, one eight dollar plate of chicken over rice can last two meals so you’re really only paying about $4!\n\nRice Platters\n\n\n\nType\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nChicken over Rice\n$8\n\n\nLamb over Rice\n$8\n\n\nCombo over Rice\n$9\n\n\nFish over Rice\n$9\n\n\nShrimp over Rice\n$9\n\n\nFalafel over Rice\n$8\n\n\nChickpea over Rice\n$8\n\n\n\n\n\nSalads\n\n\n\nType\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nChicken Salad\n$8\n\n\nLamb Salad\n$8\n\n\nChicken and Lamb Salad\n$9\n\n\nFish Salad\n$9\n\n\nFalafel Salad\n$8\n\n\n\nThe food scene and denizens of Philadelphia rely on food trucks like Rahim’s  Red Cart  across the Quad. But unfortunately, many have been pushed out by universities and policies alike. But still, I and many others feel incredibly lucky that carts like Kim’s Oriental Foods, Bui’s Lunch Truck, and the one run by an elderly couple outside of David’s Rittenhouse Laboratory are here to keep us fed and happy.\nRead more here and learn about his journey as Rahim the Dream."
