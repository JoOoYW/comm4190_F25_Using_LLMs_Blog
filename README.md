# Joy's Blog

Hi! I’m Joy and welcome to my corner of the internet.  
This repo is home to my blog where I write about:

- **AI & Tech** — thoughts, experiments, and explorations in computer science + artificial intelligence.  
- **Food & Recipes** — cooking adventures, food ratings, and the occasional recipe testing.  
- **Life & Creativity** — music, crochet projects, and whatever else sparks happiness.
