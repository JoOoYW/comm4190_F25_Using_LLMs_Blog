# Joy's Blog

Hi! I’m Joy and welcome to my corner of the internet.  
This repo is home to my blog where I write about:

- **AI & Tech** — thoughts, experiments, and explorations in computer science + artificial intelligence.  
- **Food & Recipes** — cooking adventures, food ratings, and the occasional recipe testing.  
- **Life & Creativity** — music, crochet projects, and whatever else sparks happiness.  

## Why this blog?
I wanted a space to mix both my technical side and my creative side.  
Expect posts that go from *"deep dive into AI ethics"* to *"what kind of halloween costumes can I make a day before Halloweek"*  

## Let’s connect
If you’re curious about my interest in AI, recipes, or just want to chat, feel free to connect.
